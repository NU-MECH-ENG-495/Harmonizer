### Project Idea

This project will be centered around the idea of controlling servo motors with C++ to accurately play songs with an instrument.
The application will be able to parse an input song of your choice, I will start with .mp3 files but would like to eventually scrape the
audio data off of youtube. With the audio input, I will conduct audio analysis to find the timing of different notes being played and use this
as the control scheme for a series of servo moters to play an instrument. A basic approach to this will be to use a stepper motor, an air pump, and
a harmonica. The motor will be able to move the harmonica to play the appropriate note as determined from the audio.
