### Project Idea

This project will be centered around the idea of controlling servo motors with C++ to build a simple catapult.
The focus will be on the control, and as such the hardware will be very simiple. It will involve one servo on the bottom
to spin a small platform as a way to aim and another to pull the launch arm back. These together should provide a rudamentry
but interesting setup to controll through C++. Once a basic hardwarre and control system is established I would like to integrate
speach to text into the project to give commands to the catapult through voice.

As this is a C++ project, beyond the basic hardware I intend to put most of the project effort into the control code.
I would like to write an API interface to control the servo setup and then write a seperate application to interface with these classes
to program various voice commands.
